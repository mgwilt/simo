# Verification

- `E-001` verifies `A-001` at `800e5d0`: native build/test, package installation, Mac hardware preflight, deterministic headless execution, full Python tests, and truthful missing-live-prerequisite reporting.
- The complete Pipecat loop, model execution, audio I/O, interruption, latency, OKF runtime graph, and operational readiness remain unverified.
