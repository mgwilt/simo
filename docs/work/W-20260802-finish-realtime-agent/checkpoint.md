# Checkpoint

- Base revision: `43c5523ef9b935f58a3c9474d7cc8bfa4eb69968`.
- Dirty paths at activation: none.
- Completed predecessor: `W-20260802-semantic-context-spine` (`DOC-0002`, `DOC-0003`).
- Completed: `T-001` selected the MLX-native Qwen3-TTS 0.6B CustomVoice 6-bit, Parakeet TDT 0.6B v3, and Qwen3.5 4B 4-bit defaults for the Apple M3 Ultra target.
- Completed: `T-002` added the installed `simo` command, typed environment configuration, a truthful two-mode preflight, a system-compiler native build, and the deterministic headless lifecycle at `800e5d0`.
- Active: `T-003` Pipecat context-snapshot injection and the deterministic full fake-provider pipeline.
- Blocker: none.
- Next action: implement an immutable per-turn snapshot injection processor and exercise observation, world progression, text inference, TTS frames, and shutdown in one Pipecat pipeline.
